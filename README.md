## Build and Run on the Quest 3

- If you want to run in the Unity Editor, please first setup [Meta Quest Link](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-link/set-up-link/). Note that the **Passthrough** and **DepthAPI** might not work optimally if run in the Unity Editor.
- Make sure the **ROS IP Address** is set to the IP of your ROS machine. It can be found in `Robotics > ROS Settings`.
- Switch the build platform to **Android**.
- Fix all issues in `Project Settings > Meta XR`.
- After building, you can use [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/) to install the APK file on your Quest 3.

## Troubleshooting

### Problems with Android build

#### [Fail to export Android package due to URDF importer](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/URDF-Importer/issues/212)

- Enter into `Packages/com.unity.robotics.urdf-importer/Runtime/UnityMeshImporter/Plugins/AssimpNet/Native/win/x86/`
- Delete `assimp.dll` and `assimp.dll.meta`
- Note: Packages are stored in `Library/PackageCache/` if using Unity's Package Manager.

#### [Unable to build due to namespace errors](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub/issues/215)

- Tick the `Android` checkbox in `Platforms` of `Unity.Robotics.URDFImporter.asmdef`
